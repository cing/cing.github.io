I'm a Canadian computational scientist, DJ, and aspiring Pythonista. I was born in [Orangeville, Ontario, Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangeville,_Ontario). I studied Physics at University of Waterloo and I'm finishing my doctorate in Biochemistry at University of Toronto. On a day-to-day basis, I'm trying to make sense of molecular biophysics, machine learning, and cats. I have a long standing fascination with the intersection of art and science (and sometimes education).

Some of my favorite things:

* **Movies:** Apocalypse Now, Adaptation, The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, Eight Diagram Pole Fighter
* **TV:** How It's Made, Berserk, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, 30 Rock
