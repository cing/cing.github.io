I've been DJing parties, clubs, and weddings as **[Spacetime](https://www.mixcloud.com/spacetime/)** for the past 10 years (!). I spin mostly hip-hop (mainstream, underground, grime, R&B, instrumental) and electronic (electronia, techno, house, bass), but I mix music of all genres and decades. I perform using Technics 1200's with Traktor and I make song edits with Ableton. Contact me if you'd like testimonials or a quote for my services in the Greater Toronto Area.
